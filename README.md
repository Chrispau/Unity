# Unity

My scene is a basic scene in a futuristic looking “house” set. 
The house is an open room, meaning that the room is exposed outside 
and the camera is placed in the middle of the room so we don’t see the openness. 
The door is open and we can see the empty space behind it.
I included some furniture and food items from the Unity Asset Store. 
The main character (another asset) is a robot, named Kyle.
I was inspired by some aesthetics such as the Portal game series and the film Tron Legacy.
